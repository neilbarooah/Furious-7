Our movie is about two cars racing each other. It is the sequel of Furious 007. 
One of the car crashes half way through the movie. The other one goes on to win the race. 
But revenge is a thing in this world. The crashed car reverses and zooms forward towards the winner and crashes on it, becoming the ultimate winner of this race. 
Tadaaa!!!

This movie uses quite a few of the effects that we created in HW7. We used the zoom effect for the first image of the 2 cars, and for the image of the race track. We used the fade effect in the first portion of the movie where the 2 cars are at the start line. 

We also made use of red tint when the car crashes for the first time to create a boom effect. Subsequently, as the first car crashes onto the other car, we slowed down the progression of frames to create a slow-down effect to focus on the revenge. 

Our filming code contains the code to maneuver the robot that was filming the race the entire time.

Our acting code contains the code for the entire race - all turns, forward, backward etc. In this code, we saved the scene into a gif file - technically doing what we were supposed to do in the performance code. 

And editing code - contains the code for all the special effects. 

The performance code and acting code merging is the deviation we made in this assignment. Also, we used iMovie to compile all the frames into a movie, and have also added music, sound effects and the title page using the same. Hence, we didn't include the performance code.
